## Projecting Outcomes Sports Analytics Project

These are valuable to:
- sports gambling
- fantasy sports
- teams

For example, calc spread for each game over the course of basketball season. Accurately means you can bet on these.

## Value Sports Analytics Project

More focused on:
- how many wins a player will create
- how much value a player will add to a team
- should they draft or trade for a certain player
- understanding a player's impact performance
- player attributes vs performance

For example, physical data of running backs, does hand size correlate to fumbling the football

## How many games does a team play?

Let's say I am the Warriors.
- play each team in my division 4 times = 16 games
- play the other 10 teams in my conference 3-4 times = 36 games + 16 games = 52 games
- play the other 15 non-conference teams twice, home and away = 30 games + 52 games = 82 games TOTAL

Only 16 teams qualify for the playoffs each season, 8 from each conference.
- the top 6 teams from eastern and western conference get in automatically
- teams in 7th to 10th positions compete in the play-in tournament
- teams in 11th to 15th positions are eliminated from post season contention

## The Play-ins

There are 6 games total, 3 per conference.

So for the Western conference: **7th-pos vs 8th-pos**  AND  **9th-pos vs 10th-pos**
    **7-8 GAME**: 7/8-Winner makes it to the playoffs, to 7th-seed
    **9-10 GAME**: 9/10-loser is knocked-out
    **PLAY-IN GAME**: 7/8-loser plays 9/10-Winner, then winner here goes to playoffs, to 8th-seed
The same goes for the Eastern conference.

## The Playoffs

The champions are crowned here.
- 16 teams, need to win 4 rounds to be champs, 2 weeks per round (2 months total)
- not single elimination

Rounds:
- 1st round: all 16 teams compete, first team to win 4 games advances
- 2nd round: conference semi-finals

## How to become a NBA player?

There's the G-league, established in 2001. There are some minor league affiliates here.
There are also college ranks; the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Players get drafted and/or signed for an NBA team straight out of college.

## What are the NBA acronyms?

These are the measures of the NBA standings.

- **W** - Win
- **L** - Loss
- **Pct** - Winning Percentage, W/(W+L)
- **GB** - Games Back/ Behind, how many wins are needed for teams to catch up to first place. The value indicates how many games each team trails their first-place, **divisional rival**. Games Back values shift in increments of 0.5 per game played, per team.
- **Conf 20-10** - 20 wins in conf and 10 losses in conf, a Conference Record is a team’s record playing **their own** conference rivals
- **Home 18-5** - 18 wins at home and 5 losses at home
- **Away/Road 17-9** - 17 wins away/road and 9 losses away/road
- **L10** - Last 10 games, no role in team standings.
- **Strk** - Recent Winning or Losing Streak, e.g. W6 means the team won their last 6 consecutive games OR L2 means the team lost their lost 2 consecutive games

### Games Back Example

CELTICS: 30-25 (W/L)
KNICKS: 26-28 (W/L)

__Win Differential:__

Wins for Higher Ranked – Wins for Lower Ranked
30-26 = 4

Games Behind for Wins: Win Differential/2 
4/2 = 2

__Loss Differential:__

Losses for Lower Ranked – Losses for Higher Ranked
28-25 = 3

Games Behind for Losses: Loss Differential/2 
3/2 = 1.5

Games Back = Games Behind for Wins + Games Behind for Losses
**Games Back = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5**
______________________________________________________________

Other measures include, which may or may not affect the NBA standings:

- **DIV** - The division record refers to a team’s record playing divisional rivals. There are 6 divisions, three in each conference. DIV may play a role to settle tie-breakers in the standings.
- **OT 5-2** - 5 wins in overtime and 2 losses in overtime,no role in a team’s position in the standings
- **PF/ PPG** – Points For/ Points Per Game Scored, is the average number of points a team scores each game.
- **PA** – Points Allowed/ Against is the average number of points the opponents scored against the team in question.
- **DIFF** – Points Differential/ Net Points is the difference between the Points For and Points Allowed for any given team, used to settle the tie-breaking procedure between two or more teams.
